Gravitic
========

Gravitic is a tool which is designed to make designing analysis and training pipelines easy.

It was developed to make creating new pipelines for analysing gravitational wave data, removing the need to create new infrastructure for data handling.
Gravitic builds pipelines from blocks, allowing individual parts to be swapped easily, and simplifying the process of prototyping new analyses.

Gravitic is designed from the ground-up to be compatible with LIGO's asimov toolkit, allowing gravitic pipelines to be managed and automated using the same tools used for established pipelines.
